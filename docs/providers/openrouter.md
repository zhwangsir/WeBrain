# OpenRouter

OpenRouter provides a **unified API** that routes requests to many models behind a single
endpoint and API key. It is OpenAI-compatible, so most OpenAI SDKs work by switching the base URL.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Create an API key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run onboarding">
    ```bash
    openclaw onboard --auth-choice openrouter-api-key
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Switch to a specific model">
    Onboarding defaults to `openrouter/auto`. Pick a concrete model later:

    ```bash
    openclaw models set openrouter/<provider>/<model>
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Config example

```json5
{
  env: { OPENROUTER_API_KEY: "sk-or-..." },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "openrouter/auto" },
    },
  },
}
```

## Model references

<Note>
Model refs follow the pattern `openrouter/<provider>/<model>`. For the full list of
available providers and models, see [/concepts/model-providers](/concepts/model-providers).
</Note>

## Authentication and headers

OpenRouter uses a Bearer token with your API key under the hood.

On real OpenRouter requests (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`), WineryClaw also adds
OpenRouter's documented app-attribution headers:

| Header                    | Value                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `HTTP-Referer`            | `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw` |
| `X-OpenRouter-Title`      | `WineryClaw`            |
| `X-OpenRouter-Categories` | `cli-agent`           |

<Warning>
If you repoint the OpenRouter provider at some other proxy or base URL, WineryClaw
does **not** inject those OpenRouter-specific headers or Anthropic cache markers.
</Warning>

## Advanced notes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Anthropic cache markers">
    On verified OpenRouter routes, Anthropic model refs keep the
    OpenRouter-specific Anthropic `cache_control` markers that WineryClaw uses for
    better prompt-cache reuse on system/developer prompt blocks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thinking / reasoning injection">
    On supported non-`auto` routes, WineryClaw maps the selected thinking level to
    OpenRouter proxy reasoning payloads. Unsupported model hints and
    `openrouter/auto` skip that reasoning injection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenAI-only request shaping">
    OpenRouter still runs through the proxy-style OpenAI-compatible path, so
    native OpenAI-only request shaping such as `serviceTier`, Responses `store`,
    OpenAI reasoning-compat payloads, and prompt-cache hints is not forwarded.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gemini-backed routes">
    Gemini-backed OpenRouter refs stay on the proxy-Gemini path: WineryClaw keeps
    Gemini thought-signature sanitation there, but does not enable native Gemini
    replay validation or bootstrap rewrites.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provider routing metadata">
    If you pass OpenRouter provider routing under model params, WineryClaw forwards
    it as OpenRouter routing metadata before the shared stream wrappers run.
  </Accordion>
