# Web Search — Free Local Search via ReadPage

Search the web by reading search engine result pages directly through your local Chrome browser with `dokobot read --local`. No search API needed. No cost. No rate limits. Results come from the same search engine page you'd see in your browser.

## How it works

Construct a search engine URL with your query, then read the page with `dokobot read --local`. The browser renders the full page (including JavaScript), and dokobot extracts the search results as structured text.

```bash
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.com/search?q=your+query+here'
```

## Supported search engines

| Engine | URL pattern |
|--------|------------|
| Google | `https://www.google.com/search?q=your+query` |
| Bing | `https://www.bing.com/search?q=your+query` |
| DuckDuckGo | `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=your+query` |
| X / Twitter | `https://x.com/search?q=your+query&src=typed_query` |
| Baidu | `https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=your+query` |
| Yandex | `https://yandex.com/search/?text=your+query` |
| Sogou | `https://www.sogou.com/web?query=your+query` |

Use whichever engine suits the query. Google is the default choice for most searches. For platform-specific requests, use the platform URL first. For Chinese content, Baidu or Sogou may return better results.

## Query construction

URL-encode the query when building the URL. Replace spaces with `+` or `%20`.

```bash
# Simple query
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.com/search?q=rust+web+frameworks+2025'

# Exact phrase
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.com/search?q=%22exact+phrase%22'

# Site-scoped search
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agithub.com+dokobot'

# Exclude terms
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.com/search?q=python+web+framework+-django'

# Recent results (Google tbs param: past year)
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.com/search?q=llm+benchmarks&tbs=qdr:y'
```

## Search workflow

A typical search-then-read workflow:

```bash
# Step 1: Search
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.com/search?q=best+rust+web+frameworks+2025'

# Step 2: Pick the most relevant URL from results and read it
dokobot read --local 'https://example.com/rust-frameworks-comparison'

# Step 3: Refine and search again if needed
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.com/search?q=actix-web+vs+axum+performance'
```

## Dynamic or platform search pages

For result pages that render lazily or require login state, such as X/Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other feed-style pages, use a continuation-first workflow:

```bash
dokobot read --local '<search-url>' --screens 5 --timeout 90
dokobot read --local '<search-url>' --session-id <SESSION_ID> --screens 5 --timeout 90
```

- If the first result is sparse or mostly empty but prints `Session: <id>`, continue that same session before switching sources.
- If a platform-specific search was requested, try the platform URL first. Use a search-engine fallback like `site:x.com query` only after the platform read fails or exposes no useful text.
- In the final answer, say whether the results came directly from the requested platform or from a fallback search engine.

## Multi-language search

Search in the target language for best results. The browser's locale and login state affect what the search engine returns.

```bash
# Chinese search
dokobot read --local 'https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=Rust+Web框架+对比+2025'

# Japanese search
dokobot read --local 'https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=Rust+Webフレームワーク+比較'
```

## Tips

- **Always use `--local`** — free, fast, unlimited, and uses your browser's logged-in sessions and locale
- **Google is the default** for most queries, but switch engines when appropriate
- **Read the results page first**, then read individual URLs — don't guess URLs
- **Refine queries** iteratively based on what you find
- **Use search operators** (site:, "exact phrase", -exclude) for precision
- **Continue dynamic pages first** — when output includes `Session: <id>`, use `--session-id` with more `--screens` before falling back
- **Space out requests** if a search engine shows CAPTCHAs

## Limitations

- Results depend on your browser's locale, region, and login state
- CAPTCHAs may appear after many rapid searches from the same engine — switch engines or wait
- Some search engines and platform pages load results dynamically — dokobot handles JavaScript rendering, but infinite-scroll results may require `--screens` and `--session-id`
- Platform pages can return a blank extraction when the browser is logged out, rate limited, blocked, or the feed has not rendered yet
